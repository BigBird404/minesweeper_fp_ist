# 🎓 IST - Fundamentals of Programming Projects

This repository contains two academic projects developed for the **Fundamentals of Programming** course at the **Instituto Superior Técnico** (LEIC - 1st year).

Each folder contains an individual project, fully self-contained with its own implementation and documentation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder | Project | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `project1/` | **Text Formatting, Election Simulation, and Linear Systems** | Implements text justification algorithms, an electoral seat allocation system (D’Hondt method), and a Jacobi iterative solver for linear systems. |
| `project2/` | **Minesweeper Game (Functional Programming)** | A functional-style implementation of the Minesweeper game, including random generation (xorshift), coordinate systems, and user interaction logic. |

Each project folder includes:
- `main.py` — the project implementation
- `test.py` — a set of tests for the project functions  
- `README.md` — detailed documentation (in English) explaining the code structure, logic, and usage examples.
